<a name="what"><h3> What Nrrd Is </h3></a>


Nrrd is a tool for representing and processing N-dimensional raster
data.  It offers an efficient and general way to manipulate scientific
and medical images and volumes.  Nrrd facilitates the pre-processing
tasks that often precede visualization or segmentation (cropping,
quantizing, resampling), as well as the basic analysis tasks which
help to understand the structure of a dataset (histograms, maximum
intensity projections, connected components).  Nrrd has a persistent
habit of replacing the throw-away one-time code that people often
write to transform datasets, while also offering a convenient,
flexible, and portable file format for storing the data.

<p>

In memory and on disk, the scanline ordering of the data on a regular
lattice imposes a strict linear ordering of all the samples.  A basic
capability of nrrd is managing the relationship between the
multi-dimensional logical structure of raster data, and its
one-dimensional physical layout.  There are four fundamental aspects
of this sort of data: the dimension of the grid, the raster order of
the samples, additional information about each axis, and the type of
data associated with each sample point.  These four aspects are now
considered in more detail.

<p>

<a name="dimension"><h3> Data Dimension </h3></a>

Nrrd is intended to represent raster data of any dimension greater
than zero.  Ideally there would be no run-time limit on the
representable dimension.  The current implementation (the <b>nrrd</b>
library) has put a <tt>#define</tt> limit on the dimension;
<tt>NRRD_DIM_MAX</tt> is currently set to 16.  One subtle aspect of
dimension involves the handling of non-scalar data.  A simplifying
design decision in nrrd is that "everything is a scalar".
Thus, in order to represent a 3-dimensional field of vectors, a
<b>4</b>-dimensional nrrd is used, usually with the (X,Y,Z) components
of the vector interleaved between sample points.  In this case, the
first axis has 3 samples, while the second, third, and fourth axes
correspond to the spatial dimensions of the grid.  "Everything is a
scalar" because the vector field is represented as a 4-D array of
scalars instead of a 3-D array of vectors.  In contrast, for scalar 3-D
data, the spatial dimensions are represented by the first, second, and
third axes of a 3-dimensional nrrd.  While it be seem strange to be
using nrrds of different dimensions for what is conceptually the same
grid, experience has shown that this is not a hinderance to using
nrrds to represent and operate on scalar, vector, and tensor data,
especially given the low-level flavor of the <b>nrrd</b> functions.

<p>

Having complete dimensional generality complicates the terms
"dimension" and "dimensions".  While "dimension" (singular) could be
used strictly to refer to the dimensionality of the grid itself (1 for
histograms, 2 for grayscale images, 3 for color images, etc.), and
"dimensions" (plural) could refer to the number of samples along the
axes, this seems risky.  In the context of nrrd, "dimension" is used
solely in in the former sense (how many dimensions are there), and
"size" is always used in the latter sense (how many samples are
there).  Another possibility would have to use "dimensions" and "rank"
for the two terms.  Thus, an NTSC color image represented in nrrd
would have dimension 3, with sizes 3, 640, and 480.  

<a name="order"><h3> Raster Order</h3></a>

The ordering of axes is fundamental.  In nrrd, whenever the axes are
represented or identified in sequence, the ordering is always from
"fastest" to "slowest".  If we assign coordinates to each axis, and
traverse the physical layout of the raster data from the first sample
(with all zero coordinates) to the last sample, the fastest axis
corresponds to that coordinate which increments fastest as we traverse
the samples.  Thus, nrrd's axis ordering for typical interleaved color
image data is color, horizontal, and vertical.

<p>

What we call these axes is an entirely seperate issue of convention:
"X" could refer to the fastest or slowest spatial dimension.
Different schemes for creating multidimensional arrays in C/C++ have
different associated axes ordering.  Indexing data by
<tt>val[x][y][z]</tt>, for instance, implies that the X axis is
slowest.  On the other hand, if <tt>sx</tt> and <tt>sy</tt> are the
sizes of the X and Y axes, respectively, then indexing data by
<tt>*(val&nbsp;+&nbsp;x&nbsp;+&nbsp;sx*(y&nbsp;+&nbsp;sy*z))</tt>
implies that the X axis is fastest.  Nrrd is wholly agnostic on these
matters; it imposes or implies no policy on axis names or on indexing
methods.  Axes are identified in <b>nrrd</b> only by their integral
index into the axis ordering.  For the color data example mentioned
above, the color axis is 0, horizontal is 1, and vertical is 2.


<a name="axes"><h3> Data Axes </h3></a>

There are many aspects of an axis that nrrd can represent.  The number
of samples is the only required information.  There is a
dynamically allocated <tt>char*</tt> string which can be used to give
a name to each axis.  The spacing
between samples is also represented, and if there is a known extent to
the axis in some "world" space, the min and max position of the axis
can also be represented.  Univariate histograms and joint histograms
naturally have a min and max along their axes; many volume datasets
have only a notion of spacing.  Whether the samples along an axis are cell or
node centered can also be indicated.  This plays an important role in
representing histograms (necessarily cell-centered) and image data
(probably cell-centered if you're talking about mipmaps, but
node-centered in many other signal-processing contexts).  

<p>

All this peripheral information describing each axis is saved to the
NRRD file with <tt>nrrdSave()</tt> and <tt>nrrdWrite()</tt>, and 
read in with <tt>nrrdLoad()</tt> and <tt>nrrdRead()</tt>.  Also,
the axis information follows each axis through all the basic
<b>nrrd</b> operations.  For example, if you have a volume with axis
labels "x", "y", and "z", and you use <tt>nrrdSlice()</tt> to cut the
volume along axis 0, the resulting 2-dimensional nrrd will have axis
labels "y" and "z".  If you use <tt>nrrdSpatialResample()</tt> to
downsample a 640x480 cell-centered grayscale image, with spacings 1.0
and 1.0, to a 256x256 image, the resulting spacings will be 2.5 and
1.875 (but 2.50588 and 1.87843 if it was node-centered).  The proper
and intelligent handling of peripheral information, such as
cell-vs-node centering, and axis-specific sample spacing, is the
central difference between "nearly raw" and "raw" raster data.  The
absence of flexible and powerful tools for operating on nearly raw
raster data with complete dimensional generality was the primary
motivation for starting <b>nrrd</b> development in 1998.  The rest of
the <b>teem</b> libraries grew out of <b>nrrd</b>.

<p>

<a name="type"><h3> Data Type </h3></a>

Nrrd can handle ten different types of scalar data.  There are 8
integral types (1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-byte integers, signed and unsigned),
and two floating point types (4-byte floats, 8-byte doubles).  These
are currently implemented with the C types "<tt>char</tt>",
"<tt>short</tt>", "<tt>int</tt>", and "<tt>long long</tt>" (prefixed
by either "<tt>signed</tt>" or "<tt>unsigned</tt>"), and
"<tt>float</tt>" and "<tt>double</tt>".  Although "<tt>long
double</tt>" is available on many systems, it has no standard size (8
bytes on Mac OSX, 12 bytes on Intel, 16 bytes elsewhere), so it is not
included in nrrd.

<p>

The cautious and principled C/C++ programmer will quickly point out,
however, that <b>no</b> type can be counted on to have a specific
bit-size, according to the definition of the C language.  All we know
is that <tt>sizeof(char)</tt> is 1, but a <tt>char</tt> need not be 8
bits. Only the C99 language offers guaranteed bit-length
representation of types.  In spite of this, and to its pleasant
surprise, nrrd development actually has yet to encounter a machine on
which the types sizes listed above did not hold, or on which a byte
was not 8 bits.  Thus, the C types listed above are common in the
<b>nrrd</b> implementation across all platforms: GNU/Linux, Solaris (32
and 64 bit), and Irix (32 and 64 bit), Mac OSX, and Windows (which has
different names for the 8-byte integers).  As soon as one presents
itself, a machine with different underlying type sizes will provide
the opportunity and context for implementing and testing a system of
type abstraction which has, to date, not been required.

<p>

There is one final nrrd type, called "block".  This is actually not a
scalar, but an opaque chunk of memory of some specified length.  This
allows nrrd to represent and operate on, for example, a volume of C
structs or C++ objects, as long as they are all the same size.  Nrrd
can't determine a scalar value from a a block, nor can it create
blocks from scalar values, so it can't do operations like
histogramming or filtered resampling on arrays of blocks.  But many
other operations are supported, such as slicing, cropping, axis
permuting, and some kinds of padding.
