This page demonstrates some of the different possible NRRD headers.
Reading through this will give some idea of what kind of data NRRD is
good at representing, but this isn't a complete indication of all the
possibilities in the format.  See the <a href="../format.html">file
format definition</a> for all the details.  The simplest way to learn
about making (simple) headers is by running the <a
href="../../unrrdu/index.html"><tt>unu</tt></a> program as:
"<tt>unu&nbsp;make</tt>".  This will print complete usage information
for the different command-line arguments.
"<tt>unu&nbsp;make&nbsp;-h</tt>" is the easiest way to start making
detached header files for existing data.

<h3>Gray-scale image</h3>
Here's an 8-bit <a href="fool.jpg">small image</a> in <a href="fool.pgm">PGM
format</a>.  The same data can be put <a href="fool.nrrd">NRRD format</a>.
The header looks like this:
<blockquote><pre>
NRRD0001
type: unsigned char
dimension: 2
sizes: 128 128
encoding: raw

WYXWYWVUVUSSTSPOPOOLKMJJJHFFFDCA  data ... data ...
</pre></blockquote>

This is the minimalist header for 2-dimensional data.  Every NRRD file
starts with the magic "<tt>NRRD0001</tt>" to unambiguously identify
the file as a NRRD file, for NRRD readers, as well as any other readers
that have to handle multiple formats.  In this case, the <a
href="../format.html#dimension"><tt>dimension</tt></a> field says that
this is two-dimensional data, and the <a
href="../format.html#sizes"><tt>sizes</tt></a> field is saying that
the array has 128 samples along both its axes.

<p>

If we wanted to create a NRRD header which referred to
the PGM image, but didn't contain any data itself, we could <a
href="fool.nhdr">write this,</a> which is the entire detached header:
<blockquote><pre>
NRRD0001
type: unsigned char
dimension: 2
sizes: 128 128
encoding: raw
data file: ./fool.pgm
line skip: 3
</pre></blockquote>

Assuming that <tt>fool.pgm</tt> is in the same directory as this
header file, the detached header is as good as <a
href="fool.nrrd"><tt>fool.nrrd</tt></a>, usable from any other working
directory.

<p>

With either detached or attached headers, its easy to add comments
to the header.  They start with "<tt>#</tt>" and go to the line termination,
and can be anywhere after the magic:
<blockquote><pre>
NRRD0001
content: freshman year foolishness in Risley Hall
type: unsigned char
dimension: 2
# the original size was much larger
sizes: 128 128
encoding: raw
data file: ./fool.pgm
# this skips past the PPM header, more lines would have to be
# skipped if there where comments in the PPM file itself.
line skip: 3
</pre></blockquote>

The <a href="../format.html#content"><tt>content</tt></a> field is
effectively a comment, but is intended to serve as a concise textual
description of the contents of the NRRD file.

<p>

But so far this has just been an exercise to demonstrate the NRRD
header.  For data that can be stored in a PPM or PGM image, you might
as well use PGM and PPM images, since the <a
href="../index.html"><b>nrrd</b></a> library can natively read and
write PGM and PPM images with the exact same <tt>nrrdLoad()</tt> and
<tt>nrrdSave()</tt> library calls as for NRRD files.

<p>

If the type of the data is 32-bit <tt>float</tt> instead of
<tt>unsigned char</tt>, then <a href="../format.html#endian">byte
ordering</a> (endianness) information is required in the header: <a
href="foolf.nrrd"><tt>foolf.nrrd</tt></a>

<blockquote><pre>
NRRD0001
type: float
dimension: 2
sizes: 128 128
endian: big
encoding: raw

raw data ... data ...
</pre></blockquote>

If this had been written in a linux, cygwin, or windows box, the
endian line would instead say "<tt>endian: little</tt>".  NRRD readers
know how to read either byte ordering, and no particular byte ordering
is favored in the NRRD format.  <a href="../format.html#type">Other
possible types</a> include "<tt>int</tt>", "<tt>short</tt>", and
"<tt>double</tt>".


<h3>Color image</h3>

Because NRRD adopts the simple philosophy that "everything is a
scalar", <a href="foolc.jpg">a color image</a> (also available in <a
href="fool.ppm">PPM format</a>) is actually a 3-dimensional array,
with a short 3-sample-long axis preceeding the spatial axes (<a
href="foolc.nrrd"><tt>foolc.nrrd</tt></a>):

<blockquote><pre>
NRRD0001
type: unsigned char
dimension: 3
sizes: 3 128 128
encoding: raw

X[JXYIWXFWXIXYIWVFV ... data ... data ...
</pre></blockquote>

In NRRD, whenever a field is giving information about each and every
field (called "per-axis field"), the ordering of the axes is always
fastest to slowest.

<p>

Nearly all the field identifiers and descriptors are case-insensitive.
The header above could just as well be:

<blockquote><pre>
NRRD0001
TYPE: UNSIGNED CHAR
DIMENSION: 3
SIZES: 3 128 128
ENCODING: RAW

X[JXYIWXFWXIXYIWVFV ... data ... data ...
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

Except for the fact that the per-axis fields must follow the
<tt>dimension</tt> field, the fields can appear in any order.  Also,
some of the fields, (such as <a
href="../format.html#type"><tt>type</tt></a>) admit alternatives, so
this is valid and equivalent:

<blockquote><pre>
NRRD0001
dimension: 3
encoding: raw
sizes: 3 128 128
type: uchar

X[JXYIWXFWXIXYIWVFV ... data ... data ...
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Scalar volume data</h3>

<a href="http://www.volvis.org/">volvis.org</a> has a number of volume
datasets, all of them gzip-compressed raw unsigned chars.  Because
NRRD can handle various encodings, including gzip and bzip2
compression, it is easy to make a detached header for these volumes,
without ever having to uncompress them.

<p>

For instance, here's a header for <a href="http://www.gris.uni-tuebingen.de/areas/scivis/volren/datasets/data/aneurism.raw.gz">aneurism.raw.gz</a>.  If your
web browser decides to be helpful and uncompress the file as part of downloading, then use <a href="http://www.xach.com/snarf/">snarf</a> to get the URL
directly.
<blockquote><pre>
NRRD0001
content: aneurism
# Courtesy of Philips Research, Hamburg, Germany
dimension: 3
type: uchar
sizes: 256 256 256
spacings: 1 1 1
data file: ./aneurism.raw.gz
encoding: gzip
</pre></blockquote>

Except for the comment noting the original source of the data, a
functionally identical header can be generated with one invocation
of <tt>unu make -h</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>
unu make -h -i ./aneurism.raw.gz -t uchar -s 256 256 256 -sp 1 1 1 \
-c aneurism -e gzip -o <a href="aneur.nhdr">aneur.nhdr</a>
</pre></blockquote>

We record <a href="../format.html#spacings"><tt>spacings</tt></a> for
this dataset because unlike the previous examples, we know that
information with certainty now.  NRRD never forces you to represent
information you don't actually know.  The <a
href="../format.html#encoding"><tt>encoding</tt></a> field is what
identifies this as gzip compressed data.  This is fully inter-operable
with the command-line gzip/gunzip tools.  In this case, compression
allows the dataset to be <b>fifty</b> times smaller, and the ability
to leave data compressed is very conveniant.

<p>

If we save the header above to a file <a
href="aneurism.nhdr"><tt>aneurism.nhdr</tt></a>, in the same directory
as the <tt>aneurism.raw.gz</tt> file, then we're done.  We
can immediately start using <a
href="../../unrrdu/index.html"><tt>unu</tt></a>, for instance, to start
inspecting the data:

<blockquote><pre>
unu project -i aneurism.nhdr -a 0 -m max -o <a href="an-max.pgm">an-max.pgm</a>
</pre></blockquote>
<center>
<img src="an-max.jpg" width=256 height=256 alt="an-max">
</center>

<blockquote><pre>
unu project -i aneurism.nhdr -a 0 -m variance | unu gamma -g 4 \
| unu quantize -b 8 -o <a href="an-var.pgm">an-var.pgm</a>
</pre></blockquote>
<center>
<img src="an-var.jpg" width=256 height=256 alt="an-var">
</center>

<h3>Univariate histograms</h3>

Histograms, joint histograms, and scatterplots are all raster data,
just like images, so NRRD can represents them as well.  The histogram
of the aneurysm dataset, for instance, is a 1-D nrrd:
<blockquote><pre>
unu histo -i aneurism.nhdr -b 256 | unu save -f nrrd -e ascii -o <a href="an-hist.nrrd">an-hist.nrrd</a>

NRRD0001
content: histo(aneurism,256)
type: unsigned int
dimension: 1
sizes: 256
axis mins: 0
axis maxs: 255
centers: cell
labels: "histo(aneurism,256)"
encoding: ascii

16608268
3600
3506
3380
3097
3197
...
</pre></blockquote>

The <a href="../format.html#axismins"><tt>axis mins</tt></a> and <a
href="../format.html#axismaxs"><tt>axis maxs</tt></a> fields are used
to represent the range of values which were mapped to the lowest and
highest bins of the histogram.  Because the bins of the histogram are
necessarily cell-centered, this is recorded via the <a
href="../format.html#centers"><tt>centers</tt></a> field.
<tt>unu</tt> also tries to generate a consise verbal description of
the data it produces, based on the <tt>content</tt> field of the
input.  In this case, the new <tt>content</tt> was also used in the <a
href="../format.html#labels"><tt>labels</tt></a> field, which allows
arbitrary strings to be associated with each axis.
